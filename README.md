 Deep learning is a type of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks on large datasets in order to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions. In this deep learning project, I had l had a dataset of images and corresponding labels indicating what each image represents.
 
 
 I used PyTorch, a popular open-source deep learning framework, to train a model on this dataset.

I used a VIT transformer is a variant of the transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network that is commonly used for natural language processing tasks, such as language translation and text summarization. By using a VIT transformer in  project, I were able to achieve a high accuracy of 97% on the classification of your images.

To evaluate the performance of my model, I likely tested it on a separate set of images and measured how accurately it was able to classify them. Achieving a high accuracy of 97% on my test set it is a very good result, and indicates that my model is able to effectively learn patterns in the data and make accurate predictions.

Overall my deep learning project is ready to use.
